This is an example of how to create a Java program only using bash and makefiles.

After getting the code use the command in bash

chmod +x run.bash

This should make the bash file executable.

The next thing you should do it use the command "make"

Next run the clean.bash file

Now you should be able to execute the run.bash file you make executable to print 5
